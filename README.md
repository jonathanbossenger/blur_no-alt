# Blur No-Alt

Socially engineer your WordPress content developers to write alt text for images. This is a WordPress 5 plugin that blurs images in the WordPress editing interface if there is no alt text on the image, or if the alt text is just the filename of the image (evaluating for .jpg, .png, or .gif).

To use: Create a sub-directory in your wp-content/plugins directory called, well, you can call it anything, but how about Blur_No-Alt? And then put these two files into it. 

Then, go into your WordPress dashboard and look at your Plugins list. Activate the plugin, and you're good to go.
